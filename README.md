Please enjoy my hacked together baseball graphs!

Generally, my RE24 graphs have been made with R, and my WAR graphs with Python. I have example data files needed for these graphs with "Transposed_WAR_Data.csv" and "bballsp.csv."

Selentest.py is used to scrape Fangraphs for WAR data (I will soon add FIP scraping, but you can just change the url and the end date). Fangraphs is a little finnicky, be patient.

I've just been asking ChatGPT to organize the Selentest.py result into the right format (will automate this soon)

For the R graph, need to manually change the name positions (inluding it's date location), will automate this in a later update

For the Python graph, you need some minor adjusting of name positions.
